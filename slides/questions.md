##  Questions

- What's the selection mechanism? (rich vs poor)
- What about cultural sophistication?
  - eg you like Tribe, but don't like De La
- What if someone doesn't have facebook?
- Maybe we ask them cultural competency questions?
- How transparent should it be? (eg we're selecting based on rich vs poor)
  - data cloud: related data: for example, we're selecting based on an obscure set of interests that working class people are more likely to have
- do we announce the theme for the party beforehand?
  - eg: we could say it's for hip hop heads, but then only allow certain hip hop heads in (do you know your four elements)

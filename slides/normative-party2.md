##  Normative Party

Implicit bias towards like identities then influences us to create exclusionary groups and reinforce hierarchies by more acceptably exclusionary measures like "culture fit" and "shared interests".

The Normative Party allows us to create groups based on interests where desirability is randomly generated by a computer. It is a brief party (5-10 minutes) with drinks and food served. A variety of people line up and an objective algorithm will select who gets to enter.

Who gets in? What do they have in common? Who gets excluded? What do they have in common.
